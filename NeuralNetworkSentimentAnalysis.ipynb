    "### Improve Model's Performance and Prevent Overfitting \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can be prone to overfitting. Notice that the training accuracy is 100% but the validation accuracy is around 80%. This indicates that our model is overfitting; it will not perform as well on new, previously unseen data as it did during training. We want to have an accurate idea of how well our model will generalize to new data. Our goal is to have our training and validation accuracy scores be as close as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are different techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting, for the purpose of this exercise we will focus on two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Changing the number of epochs. Too many epochs can lead to overfitting of the training dataset, whereas too few epochs may result in underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding dropout regularization. During training, the nodes of a particular layer may always become influenced only by the output of a particular node in the previous layer, causing overfitting. Dropout regularization is a technique that randomly drops a number of nodes in a neural network during training as a way of adding randomization and preventing nodes from becoming dependent on one another. Adding dropout regularization can reduce overfitting and also improve the performance of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Task:</b> \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tweak the variable `num_epochs` above and restart and rerun all of the cells above. Evaluate the performance of the model on the training data and the validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add Keras `Dropout` layers after one or all hidden layers. Add the following line of code after you add a hidden layer to your model object:  `nn_model.add(keras.layers.Dropout(.25))`. The parameter `.25` is the fraction of the nodes to drop. You can experiment with this value as well. Restart and rerun all of the cells above. Evaluate the performance of the model on the training data and the validation data.\n",

    "In the cell below, specify the different approaches you used to reduce overfitting and summarize which configuration led to the best generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did changing the number of epochs prevent overfitting? Which value of `num_epochs` yielded the closest training and validation accuracy score? \n",
    "\n",
    "Did adding dropout layers prevent overfitting? How so? Did it also improve the accuracy score when evaluating the validation data? How many dropout layers did you add and which fraction of nodes did you drop? \n",

      "I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like \"The gun was loaded, and so was I\".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.
